This game was made for the 2022 International Educations Game Jam and was finished on the 24th of Febuary that year.

The theme of the jam was "Signal" I worked on programming the scanner function and level design which was done through random generation.

When looking through the project it is definetly not
the most tidy and well kept after all it had to be finished after 3 days of work.

I have learned much from this project after all we had to rewrite some of the scripts many times due to changes in our plan. But in the end I think we made a solid enough game.
